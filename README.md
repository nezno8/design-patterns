## Repository Description
The repository contains a simple implementation of design patterns.

## Environment Description
- Java version 17.0.4 2022-07-19 LTS
- Vendor Amazon.com Inc.
- OpenJDK Corretto-17.0.4.8.1 (build 17.0.4+8-LTS)
- Apache Maven 3.8.6

## Branch Description and How to Create It
In my project, I use different types of branches to facilitate code management and maintain project clarity.

### Branch Description
The main branch is `main`.

#### Prefixes:
- config/: Branches used for configuration and modifications of the project environment.
- feature/: Branches used for developing new features.
- bugfix/: Branches used for fixing bugs.

#### Naming Convention:
I create a new branch following the rule: `prefix/[issue-number]-[issue-description]` e.g., `config/10-environment-configuration`.

The above branch is related to issue #10 described in the [`design-patterns`](https://github.com/nezno8/design-patterns/issues/10) project.
